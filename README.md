# Waste Management and Recycling Prediction - Hackathon Report

## 1. Introduction

### Problem Overview
Urban waste management is a critical challenge facing Indian cities, with rapidly growing populations and increasing waste generation. Effective recycling is essential for sustainable urban development, reducing landfill dependency, and minimizing environmental impact. This project addresses the crucial need for data-driven approaches to optimize waste management systems across Indian cities.

### Significance
- **Environmental Impact**: Improper waste management leads to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource depletion
- **Economic Efficiency**: Optimized recycling can reduce municipal costs and create economic opportunities
- **Urban Planning**: Data-driven insights help policymakers allocate resources effectively
- **SDG Alignment**: Supports UN Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities) and 12 (Responsible Consumption)

### Project Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict recycling rates (%) for Indian cities based on waste management parameters, enabling municipalities to:
- Identify factors influencing recycling efficiency
- Optimize resource allocation
- Improve waste management strategies
- Monitor progress toward sustainability goals

## 2. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

#### Data Collection
- **Source**: Simulated dataset based on real-world Indian municipal data (2019-2023)
- **Scope**: 34 Indian cities, 5 waste types, 5-year temporal data
- **Size**: 850 records with 13 features

#### Handling Missing Values
- Numerical features: Median imputation
- Categorical features: Mode imputation
- No significant missing data found in initial analysis

#### Categorical Variable Encoding
- **High-cardinality features** (City/District, Landfill Name): Target Encoding
- **Low-cardinality features** (Waste Type): One-Hot Encoding
- **Ordinal features** (Municipal Efficiency Score): Retained as numerical

#### Data Leakage Prevention
- Removed `Disposal Method` feature due to high correlation with target variable
- Implemented group-based train-test split by City-Year combinations

### Feature Engineering

#### Geospatial Features
```python
# Distance from city center to landfill
def calculate_distance(row):
    city_coords = df.groupby('City/District')[['Landfill_Lat', 'Landfill_Lon']].mean()
    return geodesic((city_lat, city_lon), (landfill_lat, landfill_lon)).km
```

**Features Created**:
- `Landfill_Distance_km`: Distance from city center to landfill
- `Landfill_Lat`, `Landfill_Lon`: Parsed coordinates

#### Derived Features
- `Waste_Per_Capita`: Waste generation normalized by population density
- `Cost_Efficiency`: Recycling rate per unit cost (target-dependent, handled carefully)

#### Temporal Features
- `Year` treated as categorical to capture non-linear trends
- `Year_Categorical` for potential seasonal patterns
